When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This could be when you want to collaborate on a project with others, would like to work on a project potentially using a different machine or want to keep a backup version of the project, in case your computer goes kaput.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You have full control on what happens with the local files, and whether you are happy with the changes made on the external file.

Describe the differences between forsk clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is when you want to start a new section of the same project, like adding new features, or trying something experimental. A clone is where you make a copy of a project and move it to your computer, and this is to just create another copy of the project on your machine so you can use it. A fork is when you take someone elses project and make a link to it via github, and thats if you want to extend someone elses project using github.
