What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a file called .git. This allows you to set it as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows us to see what we are about to commit, and it gives more control over what ends up being committed.
